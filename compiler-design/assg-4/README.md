# Assignment 4

## Questions

1. Write a C program to represent a Grammar in (VN, ∑, P, S) format.
    Input: Set of Terminals
    Set of Non Terminals
    Set of Production Rules
    Start Symbol
    Output: The Grammar in (VN, ∑, P, S ) format.

Also check
    1. whether production exists for all non terminals
    2. whether terminals used in productions are in ∑

2. If there exist multiple productions from a single non-terminal, group them into one and represent as N -> α1/α2/……/αn.

3. Write a C program to check whether a string existing at RHS of production rule can be represented in the form of αβ or not.

4. Write a C program to calculate the FIRST for each non-terminal symbol in the grammar.

5. Write a C program to check whether a production rule can be represented as
A -> αBβ and/or A -> αB or not.

6. Write a C program to calculate the FOLLOW for each non-terminal symbol in the
grammar.

7. Construct a table with row label by non-terminal and column label as terminal symbols of a grammar.

8. Write a C program to construct a LL(1) parsing table with the help of programs 4 and 6.

```Assumption: The grammars are not left recursive and it is left factored.```

```1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 are in BASIC category, and 4, 6, and 8 are in INTELLECTUAL category.```
