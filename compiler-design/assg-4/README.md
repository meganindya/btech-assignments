# Assignment 4

## Questions

1. Write a C program to represent a Grammar in (V<sub>N</sub>, ∑, P, S) format.</br>
    *Input:*</br>
    Set of Terminals</br>
    Set of Non Terminals</br>
    Set of Production Rules</br>
    Start Symbol</br>
    
    *Output:*</br>
    The Grammar in (V<sub>N</sub>, ∑, P, S) format

    Also check a) whether production exists for all non terminals, b) terminals used in productions are in ∑.

2. If there exist multiple productions from a single non-terminal, group them into one and represent as N -> α1/α2/……/αn.

3. Write a C program to check whether a string existing at RHS of production rule can be represented in the form of αβ or not.

4. Write a C program to calculate the FIRST for each non-terminal symbol in the grammar.

5. Write a C program to check whether a production rule can be represented as
A -> αBβ and/or A -> αB or not.

6. Write a C program to calculate the FOLLOW for each non-terminal symbol in the
grammar.

7. Construct a table with row label by non-terminal and column label as terminal symbols of a grammar.

8. Write a C program to construct a LL(1) parsing table with the help of programs 4 and 6.

```Assumption: The grammars are not left recursive and it is left factored.```

```1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 are in BASIC category, and 4, 6, and 8 are in INTELLECTUAL category.```
