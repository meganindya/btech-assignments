## Comments

In each assignment directory, *programs* directory contains all the Java code for individual programs. *bin* directory is a package, having the same *.java* files as previous, with package declaration in addition. This directory also includes the class files produced post compilation.

Every assignment directory also includes a java program called *Treadmill.java* and its compiled class. This program can be used to run the programs inside *bin*. Run a program, say *Q1* with arguments *10*, *15*, with:
```java Treadmill 1 10 15```
