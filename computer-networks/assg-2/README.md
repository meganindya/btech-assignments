# Assignment 2

## Questions

1. Develop a simple web server which is capable of processing only one request. Develop a simple client which sends a request for an image file (i.e., pgm format) and the server sends the file to the client. The client after receiving the file, inverts it (255-intensity) and sends it to the server. The server after receiving it, displays the inverted image and the original image side by side.

2. Write a client ping program using UDP. The corresponding server will send a pong message back. Determine the delay between when the client sent the ping message and received the pong message. This delay is called the Round Trip Time (RTT). Report the average RTT for 10 such ping messages.
