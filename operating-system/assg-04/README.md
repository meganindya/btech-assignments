# Questions
1. Write a program which creates 2 threads. One of these prints all the odd numbers from 1 to N, the other prints all the even numbers from 1 to N. After the 2 threads terminate, the sum of all the integers from 1 to N should be computed by adding the sum of odd numbers and the sum of even numbers.

2. Implement the sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm in a divide and conquer paradigm using threads. You may divide the range of integers in various ways like continuous block distribution. Try to optimise the process by using the Primes already generated by other threads.
