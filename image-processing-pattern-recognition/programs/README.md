# Programs

Programs are contained in Jupyter (`.ipynb`) notebooks, with problem statements and output.

Each question folder contains the `.ipynb` notebook file along with `originals` and `converted`
directories, each of which contain `bmp` and `dat` directories to contain images in the respective
formats.

The input images are taken from `../immages/dat/`, and reproduced as `bmp` and `dat` in the
`originals` directory. Generated images after processing are placed accordingly in the `converted`
directory.
